## Abstract
This project introduces an AI model for predicting sugar prices based on historical data and market factors. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze past sugar price trends, macroeconomic indicators, production volumes, and supply-demand dynamics, providing accurate and reliable price forecasts. By leveraging techniques such as time series analysis, regression models, and deep learning (LSTM networks), the model is able to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in the sugar market. The predictive insights offered by this model are valuable for stakeholders in agriculture, food manufacturing, and commodities trading, helping them make informed decisions on procurement, pricing strategies, and risk management. This AI-powered approach enables a more efficient and data-driven understanding of the factors influencing sugar prices, contributing to greater stability and strategic planning in industries reliant on this essential commodity.
